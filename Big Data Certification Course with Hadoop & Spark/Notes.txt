-Hadoop is an open source project from Apache Software Foundation.
- Hadoop is written in Java
- It can effeciently process large volumes of data on clusters of commodity hardware (cheap/low level machines)
- hadoop can be setup on a single machine, but real power of hadoop comes with cluster of machines.
- consists two key parts:
  1)Hadoop Distributed File systems(HDFS) : Distribuited Storage & Data Protection Across Physical Servers
  2)Map-Reduce : Distributed Computing Across Physical Servers.
- Hadoop stores data as it is in its file system (HDFS).
- Apache Hadoop is platform for data storage as well as processing
- Has flexibity to store and Mine any type of data
- Hadoop works in Master and Slave fashion
- Master doesnt do any work, it assigns the work to slaves and get the results.
- Multiple masters are there for a cluster of slaves, because if any master goes down other master takes charge so that the clusters job will be uneffected.
- eg: user gives work to master, master distributes the work to all the slaves in that cluster and egt work completed.

-- Tableau file types
Tableau workbook (.twb) = stores visualization without source data
Tableau data source (.tds) = stores information required to access a data source
Tableau bookmark (.tbm) = stores a connection to worksheet in another workbook
Tableau data extraxt (.tde) = stores tableau data as a filtered and aggregated extract
Tableau packaged workbook (.twbx) = stores extracted data and visualization for viewing in Tableau or Tableau Reader

-- uses
we can find the relationships between tables, just by adding the excel files
We can clean up source data using data interpreter.
We can do analytics also.

-- operations on worksheets and workbooks
can return to last saved state (clicking F12)
Add,duplicate,rename worksheets
Reorder, Clear, delete worksheets
Show and hide worksheet elements
save wb as a pdf
create a packaged wb
export data to CSV file
export visualizations to Power point(.pptx)
ctrl+M used to create new worksheet
ctrl+N used to create new workbook
Tableau Viewer is a free software used for viewing .twbx (packaged wb files), they cannot access, only view

-- Arthematic Operators
+,*,-,/,%,^
-- comparision operators
=,>,<,>=,<=,<>
-- logical operators
AND,OR,NOT

we can create a calculated feild by goint to Analysis > Create calculated feild
column names are kept inside [] square braces
we can also double click on 'Marks' card to create a calculated feild directly
calculated feild created on shelf/'Marks' card cannot be used in other worksheets

-- Commonly used functions
SUM,AVG,MIN,MAX,STDEV,ABS,CEILING,FLOOR,ROUND

-- 'Quick table calculations' works on rows

-- Level of detail expression
it has 3 keywords to control calculations
include,exclude(will ignore a feild even though its part of calculation),fixed
this is also a calculated feild, it should be added from analysis menu
eg: syntax
{INCLUDE [Cust State] :SUM([Order Total])}

-- Summary Card
it will show all (min,max,avg,sum...)
it is available on 'worksheet' menu

-- percentage contribution can be calculated from 'Analysis<Percentage of' option
it can be calculated on rows,columns,pane, table

-- Forecast will help to see the change over period of time 'Analysis<Forescast'
it also shows the future value based on past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- we can sort data based on more than one feild using nested sort.

-- we can select specific items by keeping it in filter column, so we will get only
   required items on visualization.

-- we use 'wildcard filters' to filter specific items/ patterns.
   we need to drag feild into filters tab to apply any filters.
   wildcards matching will find pattern irrespective of the case(uppercase/lowercase).

-- we can organise data using limits

, like data of states with < 100 sales.
   this kind of filters is called 'condition filters'.

-- 'top filter' used to filter out top 5/ top 10 values.
   'bottom filter' used to filter out bottom 5/10 values.

-- we can also filter using parameters. we can create parameters by 'Create<Parameter' option.
   after creating parameter, we use it during filtering, instead of numbers,
   we choose the created parameter, so data will filterout based on that parameter.
   all parameters we created will be shown on left side tab under parameters section.
   if we delete a parameter, all filters that are based on that parameter will be removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Groups: used to combine multiple items into single item
   select items or rows and click on hyperlink symbol on top and select cust name
   A new Cust Name (Group) field is added.

-- Groups can be defined based on values that are related and then compare with another created group.
-- 'Find' is used to find specific item to add to group if we have large dataset.
    This option is also present in edit group section.

-- we can define a set, like creating a set of states as a region.
-- We can summarize data based on set.
-- sets are represented with symbol (circle intersection circle)
-- we can also combine two or more sets into single set.
   select the sets and right click cursor by placing on any set and select combine sets.
-- we can click any new item and click on drop down set icon, we can see option like add to any existing set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

common ways to summarize categorical data is using barcharts.
vertical barcharts are called column charts.

data which is associated with time, day or date. eg: line charts. these are called time serires data.
such data are summarized using line charts.

area fill charts show the share of contribution in reference with other dimensions of data.

pie chart displays the contribution of several parts to a total.

graphing 2 different attributes is done using scatter plots.

we can identify cluster, using scatter plot,
there is a cluster option in analytics bar, we need to drag it to our viz
p-value, f-value and other statistics related to clusters can be seen in detail clusters tab.

histogram summarize data in a vertical bar chart, where each bar represents te count of occurances.
we can edit the bin size in tableau, for better analysis.
we can right click on measure value and go to create to create custom bin.

Tree map displays values as they contribute to a whole like  a pie chart.
unlike piechart, tree map used shades of colours to show contribution.

some feilds are easier to read when we apply formatting
we can set currency format according to countries
we can also highlight a specific value. highlight tables in show me will show colors based on value.
if we hover our mouse on a specific bar/part in viz, we get info about it, that is called tooltip
we can edit that tooltip and we can also keep visualization inside a tooltip.
we can edit tooltip, my going to tooltip option in measures card.
tooltip->insert->sheet->select the sheet that should come as tooltip.

Annotation : text on viz
right click on the viz to add annotation
we can change order of feilds that appear on viz.we can drag the feild on right legend up and down.
if we close the legend tab by mistake, we can get it again from the analysis menu

A trend line is a line that is used to display how performance is changed over time.
trend lines is available in analysis menu

we can add reference lins and quartile indicator to our viz.
right click on vertical bar on the viz to find add refernce tab.

maps can be created in tableau.
we will have a measure names showing latitude and longitude, if we add them to rows and column,
when tableau identify, if our data contains geographical data, like fields with globe symbol, it will automatically generate these latitude and longitude feilds.
we will get the map on the viz.
we can add zipcode, city or any geographic feild to marks card, so it will be displayed on viz.

we can add layers to maps. that can be content or another geographic location.
we can add background layers or maps using maps menu .
we also do analysis using distance measurement tools.
if we kkep the cursor on map, we see a small tab on left top of viz, we should select right focusing arrow over there,
then chose a shape, like circle, then if we click at a place on viz and drag the cursor, we will get circle with distance
so we can calculate the area from there.
Note, if the distance is not showing, it means we are zoomed out, we nned to zoom in to find the distance.
we can turnoff pan and zoom, from map->map options
panning and zooming are enabled and disabled together, we can not use only one at a time.

we can create stories based on our visualizations.
story creation icon is present at the bottom as a symbol of opened book.
format menu also helps us to edit story backgrounds and colours etc.

we can exchange one dashboard sheet with another.
we can filter whole dashboard based on a sheet or a feild, that means all the sheets in dashboard will show the changes according to the filter.
we can do that on dashboard menu then actions option.
we can also make highlight actions.
parameters help us create veratile filters in our workbook.

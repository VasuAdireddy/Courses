In this chapter we did Segmentation and Object Detection
Methods:
simple value-based thresholding
Adaptive thresholding based on local brightness variances
Edge detection to seperate object boundaries
Using Gaussian blurs to reduce the impact of image size
Use of dilation and erosion to reduce speckles or to expand/contract segmented areas

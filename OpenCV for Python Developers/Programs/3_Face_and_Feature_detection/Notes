Good features are invariant to transformations, like lightning
Features are identified by classifiers
detection is prior step to recognition

Template Matching:
It is readyly available for feature detection
It works by searching similar pattern between two images, by taking a reference image called template and sliding around comparision image and taking difference at every position, it results in a black and white grayscale image with various intensities showing how well each position is matching.
Black colour on grayscale image means, there is no match at that position.
White means fully matching position.

Limitations of Template Matching:
Not scale invariant
Not rotation invariant, (if templete is roatated, it may not work well)


Har cascading:
These har cascades are pretrained classifiers used for face detection.
These come under supervised machine learning.
These trian on prelabled images where faces exist.


Additional Techniques to work
Face recognition
OCR text recognition
Object Tracking and Optical flow
Reading/generating QR codes

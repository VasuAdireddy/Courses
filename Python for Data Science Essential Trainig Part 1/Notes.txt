***pandas
-- It is used for data cleaning, preperation and analysis, easy to use for data visualization and machine learning
-- It is built on top of NumPy.
-- DataFrame object acts like a spreadsheet in Excel, here rows and columns are series objectives, they are indexable.

-- By default missing values are represented as Nan in python
-- If your dataset has 0's,99's or 999's , be sure to either drop or approcimate them as you would do for missing values
-- Approximating missing values gives good overall results than just dropping missing values
-- Topics in Missing values :
-- Discovering Missing Values
-- Filling Missing Values
-- Counting Missing values
-- Filter out missing values

-- removing duplicates is very important to get accurate analysis
-- concatination and transformation
	useful for getting data into order and structure for analysis
	concatination is combining data from seperate sources
	transformation is converting and reformating data into the necessary format
